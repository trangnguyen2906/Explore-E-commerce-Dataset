## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project analyzes user behavior using data from the **Flood-It freemium mobile game**, available via the **Firebase public dataset on Google BigQuery**.

The primary focus is to explore:
- 📉 Churn Rate: What percentage of users stop playing after 1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days?

- 🔁 Retention Rate: How many users return after their install date?

- ⚠️ Drop-off Points: At what point in the user journey do most players abandon the game?

- 📊 MAU & DAU: What do monthly and daily active user trends tell us about engagement?

- 🧠 Possible Reasons Behind Churn: Do uninstall patterns, short session durations, or low level completions precede user drop-off?
  
🎯 The goal is to **identify critical user behaviors** that can guide strategies to **reduce churn** and **enhance retention** in mobile games.

### 👤 Who is this project for?  
💡 **Data Analysts & Business Analysts**: looking to quantify and understand churn

💡 **Game Designers & Developers**: aiming to improve retention through data

💡**Product Managers & Growth Teams**: tracking MAU/DAU and user lifecycle

💡 **Stakeholders & Executives**: making data-informed decisions on product direction
